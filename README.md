# Hi there! 👋 I'm Usman

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here’s everything you never wanted to know about me, but are about to find out anyway.

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 **Occupation**: Full-time web developer, part-time meme curator.  
- 📍 **Location**: Somewhere between my desk and the fridge.  
- 🎨 **Skills**:  
  - Turning coffee into code. ☕➡️💻  
  - Debugging things I swore I fixed yesterday. 🐛  
  - Googling better than your average bear. 🔍🐻  

## 🛠️ Technologies I Use

- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Bootstrap, crying in front of VS Code at 2 a.m.  

## 🏆 Achievements
- Survived multiple **"It works on my machine"** arguments.  
- Accidentally deleted `prod` once (but let’s keep that between us).  
- Perfected the **art of avoiding merge conflicts**... sort of.  

## 💡 Fun Facts
- I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production. 🤷‍♂️

- I tried learning Assembly once... I'm still recovering. 😵‍💫
